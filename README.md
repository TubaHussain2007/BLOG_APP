I've developed a feature-rich blogging website using the MERN Stack, encompassing all the essential functionalities expected in a contemporary blogging platform. Here's an overview of the key features:

1. User Authentication with JWT Token:
   The website incorporates a robust user authentication system utilizing JWT tokens, ensuring secure access and data protection.

2. Modern Design:
   The website boasts a sleek and up-to-date design, providing an engaging and user-friendly interface.

3. Interactive Features:
   - Like and Bookmarks: Users can express their appreciation for posts by liking them and easily save articles for later perusal using the bookmark feature.
   - Follow & Unfollow: Fostering a sense of community, users can follow their preferred bloggers and unfollow them if their interests change.
   - Share: The website facilitates effortless sharing of captivating posts on various social media platforms.

4. Profile Section & Social Media Links:
   Each user has access to a dedicated profile section where they can furnish details about themselves, upload a profile picture, and manage their posts. Additionally, users can link their social media profiles to enhance connectivity.

While the website effectively implements these features, there may be specific functionalities that require attention to ensure they operate seamlessly. It's essential to identify and resolve any issues or bugs to provide users with a smooth and enjoyable experience.
